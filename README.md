# Pet Parenting Analysis: "Pies Zamiast Dziecka?"

This project explores the social phenomenon of "pet parenting"—choosing dogs over children—through a multidimensional analysis focused on Poland and the world.

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the "pet parenting" phenomenon, colloquially known as the "dogs instead of children" trend. The report, **"Pies Zamiast Dziecka? Wielowymiarowa Analiza Zjawiska 'Pet Parentingu' w Polsce i na Świecie,"** explores the deep demographic, economic, and cultural shifts driving this transformation.

The analysis is grounded in scientific data and examines the trend from several perspectives:

- **Biological & Evolutionary:** Investigates the neurobiology of the human-dog bond (e.g., oxytocin), and frames "pet parenting" within alloparental care and evolutionary mismatch theories.
- **Psychological:** Analyzes emotional and mental health benefits (unconditional love, stress reduction, routine, sense of purpose).
- **Economic:** Compares the costs of raising a child in Poland (346,000 PLN over 18 years) with the lower costs of dog ownership.
- **Sociological & Cultural:** Explores Polish media discourse on voluntary childlessness and compares attitudes toward pet humanization across Europe; covers neologisms like "psiecko."
- **Global Context:** Situates the trend within the Second Demographic Transition; presents case studies from Japan and South Korea.

## Key Findings

**In Poland:**
- Record-low fertility rate (1.099 in 2024) vs. Europe's highest percentage of households with a dog (49% in 2022).
- The choice is often an economic "compromise" rather than a direct replacement of a child, offering emotional fulfillment with less financial burden.
- A cultural clash exists between modern behaviors and traditional, pro-natalist values, leading to polarization and stigmatization of the voluntarily childless.

## Critical Perspectives

The analysis also addresses critical aspects, including:

- **Animal Welfare:** Risks of anthropomorphism and neglecting dogs' species-specific needs.
- **Long-term Societal Consequences:** Challenges posed by voluntary childlessness to welfare systems and old-age care.
- **The "Pet Economy":** How the market promotes and reinforces "pet parenting," creating a self-perpetuating cycle.

This work provides a nuanced understanding of why modern societies are increasingly choosing pets as family members, moving beyond simplistic judgments to explore the complex realities of life in the 21st century.
